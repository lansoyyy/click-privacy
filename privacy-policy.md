At SCiVER IT Solutions, we understand that your privacy is important to you and we are committed to protecting it. We have created this privacy policy to explain how we collect, use, and share information when you use our taxi booking app (the "App").

The App requires access to your location in order to function properly. When you use the App, we collect your location data in order to provide you with the service you have requested, such as finding the nearest available taxi and providing estimated arrival times. We may also use your location data to improve the App and to personalize your experience.

In addition to location data, the App may also collect other information about you, such as your name, phone number, and payment information. We collect this information in order to provide you with the service you have requested, to communicate with you about your account and to process your payments.

We may share your information with third parties in order to provide you with the service you have requested. For example, we may share your location data with taxi drivers in order to facilitate your ride. We may also share your information with service providers who help us operate the App, such as payment processors and hosting providers.

We take appropriate measures to protect the security of your information, but please be aware that no method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please contact us at [contact information].

By using the App, you consent to the collection, use, and sharing of your information as described in this privacy policy. We may update this policy from time to time, so please be sure to check back regularly.
